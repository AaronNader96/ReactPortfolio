            <p className="text-sm max-w-xl mb-6 font-bold">Hey there, I'm Aaron Nader, a 27-year-old web developer with a passion for crafting exceptional websites and web applications. My skill set includes a wide range of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and MySQL, as well as a mastery of popular CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.
                When I'm not coding, you can find me staying active and pursuing a healthy lifestyle. Whether it's a morning workout or a hike in the great outdoors, I believe in taking care of my physical and mental well-being. My supportive family, especially my wife Caroline, has been a crucial part of my journey and has helped me achieve my professional goals.
                I'm excited to share my portfolio with you, built on state-of-the-art technologies like Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS
